#CAR RENTAL SERVICE DATABASE MANAGEMENT PROJECT


PROBLEM STATEMENT
In this project we have designed a database management system to store information about car services. The database contains important information about the car services available when searched and accessed by a customer.
This database contains the details of the offices, employees working in the office, specifications of the cars available with the office and also the insurance details of the vehicle. It also has the record of the customers such as customer details, address, gender and customer ID. This database also maintains the transaction details of reservations done by customers such as reservation date, reservation ID, pickup location, number of days of booking and their communication details (email etc).
This database helps the people or customers to choose the type of vehicle they want. It also helps the customers in advance booking of vehicles and keep a copy of transactions as this database also stores payment details.
