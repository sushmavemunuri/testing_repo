#NORMALISATION OF RELATIONAL DATA TABLES
##1) OFFICE
Primary key: Office_ID
All attributes depend on the Office_ID,hence the table is 2NF.
All attributes depend directly on Office_ID, hence the table is in 3NF.
All determinants (Office_ID) are candidate keys, hence the table is in BCNF.
##2) EMPLOYEE
Primary key: Emp_ID
All attributes depend on the Emp_ID, hence the table is 2NF.
All attributes depend directly on Emp_ID, hence the table is in 3NF.
All determinants (Emp_ID) are candidate keys, hence the table is in BCNF.
##3) CUSTOMER
Primary key: Customer_ID
All attributes depend on the Customer_ID, hence the table is 2NF.
All attributes depend directly on Customer_ID, hence the table is in 3NF.
All determinants (Customer_Id) are candidate keys, hence the table is in BCNF.
##4) INSURANCE
Primary key: Insurance_Number
All attributes depend on the Insurance_Number, hence the table is 2NF.
All attributes depend directly on Insurance_Number, hence the table is in 3NF
All determinants (Insurance_Number) are candidate keys, hence the table is in BCNF.
##5) VEHICLE
Primary key: Car_no
All attributes depend on the car_no, hence the table is 2NF.
All attributes depend directly on car_no, hence the table is in 3NF.
All determinants (car_no) are candidate keys, hence the table is in BCNF.
##6) PAYMENT
Primary key: {Reserve_ID,Customer_ID}
All attributes depend on the {Reserve_ID,Customer_ID}, hence the table is 2NF.
All attributes depend directly on {Reserve_ID,Customer_ID}, hence the table is in 3NF.
All determinants ({Reserve_ID,Customer_ID}) are candidate keys, hence the table is in BCNF.
##7) RESERVATION
Primary key: Reserve_ID
All attributes depend on the Reserve_ID, hence the table is 2NF.
All attributes depend directly on Reserve_ID, hence the table is in 3NF.
All determinants (Reserve_ID) are candidate keys, hence the table is in BCNF.
